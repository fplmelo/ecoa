# Bio

I have a degree in Biological Sciences and a Master in Natural Sciences from the State University of Ceará, where I worked with monitoring of invasive species in the Caatinga. I'm currently doing a PhD in Plant Biology at the Federal University of Pernambuco, where I develop research on the role of exotic plants in socio-ecological systems in the Caatinga. In addition, I am a founding member and content producer on the @identplantas page on instagram, which focuses on teaching taxonomic identification to train professionals to work in the environmental area of flora through courses, lectures and thematic events in the field of botany.

# Current research

My thesis is divided into 3 chapters on exotic species in the Caatinga addressing how exotic plants affect the assembly of plant communities in the Caatinga, through an integrated analysis of socio-ecological, functional and phylogenetic aspects as major factors for understanding the impacts of biological invasion in the Caatinga.

- Exotic species

Chapter 1 will analyze how the composition of exotic species affects plant diversity and ecosystem functioning, using the Community Assembly and Ecosystem Functioning approach. It is expected as results that the presence of exotic species reduces the functional and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities in the Caatinga, as well as a decrease in biomass and productivity in the communities. Dynamics of removal of invasive species in the experiment. A - control plot with native and invasive species, B, C and D - plots with different invasive species removal configurations. On the right, it is possible to observe the different response variables to be analyzed (functional diversity, phylogenetic diversity and above-ground biomass).

- Index of susceptibility to invasion - ISI

In chapter 2, an Index of Susceptibility to Biological Invasion (ISI) will be developed, used to assess the susceptibility to biological invasion through socio-environmental variables. Here, it is expected as results the creation of the ISIEE and its validation in the Caatinga to generate a map of susceptibility to invasion.

- Ethnoecology of exotic species

In chapter III, a systematic review of the uses of plants by traditional populations will be made, analyzing the functional attributes of potential invasive alien species used in the Caatinga. It is expected that exotic species have high attributes of ruderalism and competition in socio-ecological systems of the Caatinga.

The use of plants in socio-ecological systems in the Caatinga is associated with the functional attributes of exotic species and their ecological strategies that favor their dominance in the environment.
