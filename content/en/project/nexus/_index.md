## Brief

In this proposal, we present ecological restoration as a transversal and unifying action to promote the Nexus approach (water, energy and food security) and achieve sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the Caatinga biome region. Divided into two modules, this proposal presents two action fronts to promote the sustainability of the Caatinga. First, combining the best available science, public policies, socioeconomic analysis and training, this proposal foresees the mapping of the opportunities and challenges of ecological restoration in the Caatinga with a focus on promoting water, food and energy security. Still, using the traditional knowledge of the semi-arid population combined with the most modern restoration techniques for the Caatinga, this proposal foresees the generation of in situ restoration protocols that promote the resilience and sustainability of productive socio-ecological landscapes, promoting again the Nexus approach in a scale of local management of productive landscapes. This proposal aims to demonstrate that it is possible to naturally and harmoniously ally scientific research in Ecological Restoration, one of the most important areas for the development of technological alternatives for sustainability, with the generation of public policies aligned with geopolitical objectives and goals anchored in an approach multidisciplinary (Nexus). The derived products, as well as the innovative potential of this proposal, are comprehensive and serve both planning in the public sector, implementation of experiences by organized civil society and the strengthening of an important line of research, ecological restoration, for ICTs in the Caatinga biome .
