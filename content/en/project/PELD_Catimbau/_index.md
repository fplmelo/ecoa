summary: The present project aims to assess how human disturbance and changes in rainfall
  regime affect the Caatinga ecosystemâ€™s biota at different levels of biological organization
  (i.e, from populations to ecosystem level), by correlating these aspects with the
  theoretical reference shown in macro trends already documented in the tropics. The
  LTER Catimbau is also part of the ILTER (International Long Term Ecological Research)
  network joins several other long-lasting projects developed around the world.
