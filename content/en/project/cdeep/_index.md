summary: The present project aims to assess how human disturbance and changes in rainfall
  regime affect the Caatinga ecosystem’s biota at different levels of biological organization
  (i.e, from populations to ecosystem level), by correlating these aspects with the
  theoretical reference shown in macro trends already documented in the tropics. The
  LTER Catimbau is also part of the ILTER (International Long Term Ecological Research)
  network joins several other long-lasting projects developed around the world.

## Brief

This is a controlled experiment where we are evaluating the role of exotic species, nutrient availability, water stress and disturbance on the functional and phylogenetic diversity of plants and invertebrates. We also want to understand how the relationship between diversity and ecosystem function is affected by these disturbing factors. This experiment is part of a worldwide network of studies in dry ecosystems [NutNet-Dragnet](https://nutnet.org/dragnet).
