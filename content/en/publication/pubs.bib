	abstract = {Agriculture and development transform forest ecosystems to human-modified landscapes. Decades of research in ecology have generated myriad concepts for the appropriate management of these landscapes. Yet, these concepts are often contradictory and apply at different spatial scales, making the design of biodiversity-friendly landscapes challenging. Here, we combine concepts with empirical support to design optimal landscape scenarios for forest-dwelling species. The supported concepts indicate that appropriately sized landscapes should contain ≥ 40\% forest cover, although higher percentages are likely needed in the tropics. Forest cover should be configured with c. 10\% in a very large forest patch, and the remaining 30\% in many evenly dispersed smaller patches and semi-natural treed elements (e.g. vegetation corridors). Importantly, the patches should be embedded in a high-quality matrix. The proposed landscape scenarios represent an optimal compromise between delivery of goods and services to humans and preserving most forest wildlife, and can therefore guide forest preservation and restoration strategies.},

	abstract = {Traditional pastoralism based on free-ranging goats is indispensable for the rural economy of millions of people in the Brazilian Caatinga drylands. The use of landscape as rangelands for domestic herbivores benefits humans, but understanding its impacts on vegetation is crucial to sustainable strategies. Here we assessed how free-ranging domestic goats use mixed working landscapes in the largest dry forest of the Americas. We evaluated habitat use via GPS tracking and analysis of feeding preferences. Goats preferentially used open areas near human settlements and their impact on plant community may be negligible because they feed mostly on plants widely available in modified environments. Although free-ranging, the area of use was nearly constant (95.44 ha), but the size of herds varied (2–100 animals). Our study suggests that domestic goats can be considered dwellers of human-modified landscapes, foraging close to villages, on open (i.e., degraded) areas where abundant plant species thrive. Therefore, the extensive goat pastoralism in the Caatinga may have little impact on natural vegetation and could be sustainably managed under traditional management practices. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

We examine conspicuous cases of 'winner and loser' replacements (WLRs) in tropical forests to provide a framework integrating drivers, impacts on ecological organization, and reconfiguration of ecosystem service provisioning. Most WLRs involve native species and result from changes in resource availability rather than from altered competition among species. In this context, species dispersal is a powerful force controlling community (re)assembly. Furthermore, replacements imply a nearly complete functional reorganization of assemblages and new 'packages' of ecosystem services and disservices provided by winners. WLRs can thus elucidate the multiple transitions experienced by tropical forests, and have theoretical/applied implications, including the role that human-modified landscapes may play in global-scale sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Questions: Forest's above-ground biomass is an important component of the global carbon cycle and, in forest fragments, it tends to decrease near the edges. This edge effect on biomass can be due to the number and identity of species residing at edges or due to the context of edges constraining plant functioning regardless of the species. Here, we took advantage of species-rich natural forest edges to test the role of species richness, composition, and context dependency in explaining why forest edges stock less above-ground biomass than interiors. Location: Gallery forests in Brazilian savanna (latitude 21° S, longitude 44° W). Methods: We tested the relationship between species richness and above-ground biomass in 49 forest plots (10,142 trees). We used a novel adaptation of the Price equation to calculate the impact of species composition (losses and gains) and context dependency on the differences of above-ground biomass between edges and interiors. Results: Differences in species richness and composition did not explain the lower above-ground biomass of forest edges when compared to interiors. Biomass responses were context-dependent, in which the same species achieved smaller sizes when it grew in the edge than in the interior. Conclusions: Our study shows that edge effects on biomass may operate independently of biodiversity as edges and interiors had a similar number of species but distinct above-ground biomass. Indeed, in the studied natural forest patches, the edge context itself limits plant size and, thus, the above-ground biomass stock. Beyond unveiling the underlying causes of edge effects on forest biomass, our results call for distinct policies to conserve both the carbon stocks in forest interiors but also the unique diversity of natural edges. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science},

	abstract = {Context: Tropical forests are great reservoirs of carbon but they still suffer high rates of deforestation despite their importance. Yet, large uncertainty remains about the effects of landscape-level forest loss on biomass of forest remnants, and how these effects vary with disturbance intensity at larger regional scales. Objectives: We evaluated whether the effects of forest loss on aboveground biomass (AGB) and stem density depend on the regional disturbance context. We predicted stronger responses to forest loss in intermediately disturbed regions (e.g. moderately deforested and defaunated). Methods: Using a large dataset (10.399 trees) from Brazil and Mexico, we tested the response of AGB and stem density to landscape-level forest loss. We used 136 old-growth forest sites encompassing a gradient of forest cover distributed in eight Neotropical regions with contrasting disturbance conditions. Regional disturbance was ranked according to a gradient of deforestation level and history, matrix harshness, and defaunation degree. Results: We found that forest loss simplified forest structure within forest remnants by decreasing AGB, but mainly in moderately disturbed regions. Yet, stem density was weakly related to forest cover in most regions. Conclusions: The regional context can mediate the effect of landscape structure on AGB. Preventing forest loss and increasing forest cover at landscape scales are needed to preserve AGB and carbon stocks in anthropogenic landscapes. Such management strategies can be more effective in moderately disturbed regions where relatively small increases in forest cover can significantly enhance AGB, thereby optimizing the delivery of carbon storage and other key ecosystem services. © 2021, Springer Nature B.V.},

Taxonomic dissimilarity between exclosure and free-access was small and due to the turnover of a few species, however, tended to increase with time. Environmental co-variables, such as rainfall, forest cover, and grazing pressure were also important and have varying effects on herbaceous communities, adding complexity to the processes of species assembly of Caatinga rangelands.

A quarter of communities’ diversity is accountable to common and dominant species, while remaining species are rare. Low-latitude sites were more diverse in rare species. Communities along the coast share common and dominant species, which display high densities across all reefs, but differ in rare species that show abundance peaks in particular reef morphotypes. The disproportionate distribution of rare species reveals a higher vulnerability of these communities to impacts and stochastic density fluctuations.

Comprehending these interactions and the effectiveness of the mutualistic partners has been the central focus of ecological and evolutionary studies, as this task requires disentangling the pieces of mutualism under study. Here, we tested the hypothesis that feeding activity of Artibeus phaeotis influences density, diversity and distance effects of the seed rain of large-seeded plant species in a Neotropical dry forest of Costa Rica. We predicted that bats' activity increases density and diversity metrics on dispersing sites and that bats behave as short-distance dispersers. Our data revealed that, by dispersing hundreds of seeds within their small foraging areas and mostly close to fruiting trees, the feeding activity of A. phaeotis increases the density and richness of seeds underneath night feeding roosts. The functional role of A. phaeotis as disperser may vary among plant species, as we also detected that some seeds are more dispersed than others. Further inquiries to elucidate mutualistic interactions between frugivorous bats and large-seeded plant species should focus on understanding demographic and fitness outcomes, as strong selective pressures may be shaping morphological and behavioural traits of both plants and animals, ultimately influencing the survival of each partner. © The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Plant traits—the morphological, anatomical, physiological, biochemical and phenological characteristics of plants—determine how plants respond to environmental factors, affect other trophic levels, and influence ecosystem properties and their benefits and detriments to people. Plant trait data thus represent the basis for a vast area of research spanning from evolutionary biology, community and functional ecology, to biodiversity conservation, ecosystem and landscape management, restoration, biogeography and earth system modelling. Since its foundation in 2007, the TRY database of plant traits has grown continuously. It now provides unprecedented data coverage under an open access data policy and is the main plant trait database used by the research community worldwide. Increasingly, the TRY database also supports new frontiers of trait-based plant research, including the identification of data gaps and the subsequent mobilization or measurement of new data. To support this development, in this article we evaluate the extent of the trait data compiled in TRY and analyse emerging patterns of data coverage and representativeness. Best species coverage is achieved for categorical traits—almost complete coverage for ‘plant growth form’. However, most traits relevant for ecology and vegetation modelling are characterized by continuous intraspecific variation and trait–environmental relationships. These traits have to be measured on individual plants in their respective environment. Despite unprecedented data coverage, we observe a humbling lack of completeness and representativeness of these continuous traits in many aspects. We, therefore, conclude that reducing data gaps and biases in the TRY database remains a key challenge and requires a coordinated approach to data mobilization and trait measurements. This can only be achieved in collaboration with other initiatives. © 2019 The Authors. Global Change Biology published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Using 15 regeneration areas (from 4 to 30 years) and nine areas of mature forest, we assessed how tree seedling assemblage responds to time of abandonment and forest cover in terms of species diversity and taxonomic composition. We found that species diversity of seedlings responded positively to time of abandonment, but was not influence by forest cover. Diversity of rare and common species (0D and 1D, respectively) but not dominant species (2D) increased with time of abandonment, reaching reference values very quickly (ca. 20 years). However, species composition seemed to respond to both ageing of forest stand and landscape structure represented by forest cover. Our findings reinforce that in human-dominated landscapes, local processes related to recovery with time should be more important for plant community assembly than landscape structure, leading to a number of possibilities for multiple successional pathways.

	abstract = {Understanding how species assembly is influenced by the interplay of climate, local environmental conditions and human-caused disturbances remains a central question in ecology and conservation. Here, we assess how plant species abundance is determined by combinations of functional traits (ecological strategies) and interacting gradients of rainfall, soil conditions (fertility and field capacity) and chronic anthropogenic disturbance in a Caatinga dry tropical forest, Brazil. We tested for trait–environment relationships using multivariate methods (RLQ) accounting for groups of species sharing similar responses to gradients and similar expression of multiple traits (i.e. response groups). Overall, species’ abundances changed predictably in response to rainfall and soil fertility, and were mediated by functional traits, i.e. species with particular trait combinations tended to respond similarly to multifactorial conditions. Briefly, three ecological strategies emerged: species with low wood density and soft (i.e. lower dry matter content), thick leaves converged into a trait syndrome characterizing a drought-avoidance strategy through water storage. They were particularly abundant under extremely low precipitation and relatively high soil field capacity. Under conditions of increasing rainfall and decreasing soil field capacity, species with high wood density were favored, consistent with a drought-tolerance strategy. However, these species fell into two groups relative to leaf-investment: more conservative leaves (low SLA) on relatively fertile soils vs. thinner and softer (i.e. high SLA) leaves on unfertile soils. In seasonally dry tropical forests, low SLA on relatively fertile soils may represent a water conservation strategy. Unexpectedly, no ecological strategy emerged in response to disturbance. The patterns we uncovered help to understand the interplay between precipitation, soil fertility and anthropogenic disturbance in plant species filtering in seasonally dry tropical forests. Moreover, our results underline that impacts of future climate change will depend on how rainfall patterns covary with finer-scale environmental factors such as soil fertility and field capacity. © 2019 Gesellschaft für Ökologie},

However, a great proportion of wind farms are both currently operating or planned to be installed in areas already mapped and selected as of very high and extremely high priority for biodiversity conservation.

In this empirical study, we assess the relationship between poverty and conservation goals in dry forests within a 62,000-ha Brazilian National Park (Caatinga biome). We conducted 81 structured household interviews between January and July of 2016 to assess socioeconomic, resource management and land-use variables. We used non-parametric analysis of variance to test for differences in socioecological variables among families living inside and outside the Park and both (double dwelling). The majority of families (76\%) residing inside the Park were living below the poverty line while less than 14\% in outside and double dwelling residences faced the same issue. Families living inside the park had lower socioeconomic conditions such as limited water availability, poor house infrastructure, low income, and high dependence on firewood than outside and double dwelling families. They were also more dependent on external financial support and natural resources. We found that failures in protected areas inception and implementation have driven people towards a mutually reinforcing and declining situation in which negative socioeconomic outcomes are associated with nature degradation. Therefore, our results suggest that the future of dry forests, characterized worldwide by the presence of low-income populations, will be largely dependent on conservation strategies that address poverty alleviation and human well-being. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Habitat loss is a primary threat to biodiversity across the planet, yet contentious debate has ensued on the importance of habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ (i.e., altered spatial configuration of habitat for a given amount of habitat loss). Based on a review of landscape-scale investigations, Fahrig (2017; Ecological responses to habitat fragmentation per se. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 48:1-23) reports that biodiversity responses to habitat fragmentation ‘per se’ are more often positive rather than negative and concludes that the widespread belief in negative fragmentation effects is a ‘zombie idea’. We show that Fahrig's conclusions are drawn from a narrow and potentially biased subset of available evidence, which ignore much of the observational, experimental and theoretical evidence for negative effects of altered habitat configuration. We therefore argue that Fahrig's conclusions should be interpreted cautiously as they could be misconstrued by policy makers and managers, and we provide six arguments why they should not be applied in conservation decision-making. Reconciling the scientific disagreement, and informing conservation more effectively, will require research that goes beyond statistical and correlative approaches. This includes a more prudent use of data and conceptual models that appropriately partition direct vs indirect influences of habitat loss and altered spatial configuration, and more clearly discriminate the mechanisms underpinning any changes. Incorporating these issues will deliver greater mechanistic understanding and more predictive power to address the conservation issues arising from habitat loss and fragmentation. © 2018},

	abstract = {Aim: The conversion of old-growth tropical forests into human-modified landscapes threatens biodiversity worldwide, but its impact on the phylogenetic dimension of remaining communities is still poorly known. Negative and neutral responses of tree phylogenetic diversity to land use change have been reported at local and landscape scales. Here, we hypothesized that such variable responses to disturbance depend on the regional context, being stronger in more degraded rain forest regions with a longer history of land use. Location: Six regions in Mexico and Brazil. Methods: We used a large vegetation database (6,923 trees from 686 species) recorded in 98 50-ha landscapes distributed across two Brazilian and four Mexican regions, which exhibit different degrees of disturbance. In each region, we assessed whether phylogenetic alpha and beta diversities were related to landscape-scale forest loss, the percentage of shade-intolerant species (a proxy of local disturbance) and/or the relatedness of decreasing (losers) and increasing (winners) taxa. Results: Contrary to our expectations, the percentage of forest cover and shade-intolerant species were weakly related to phylogenetic alpha and beta diversities in all but one region. Loser species were generally as dispersed across the phylogeny as winner species, allowing more degraded, deforested and species-poorer forests to sustain relatively high levels of evolutionary (phylogenetic) diversity. Main conclusion: Our findings support previous evidence indicating that traits related to high susceptibility to forest disturbances are convergent or have low phylogenetic signal. More importantly, they reveal that the evolutionary value of disturbed forests is (at least in a phylogenetic sense) much greater than previously thought. © 2018 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

Such understanding will enable anticipation of region-specific responses to global environmental change. Modern phylogenies, in combination with broad coverage of species inventory data, now allow for global biogeographic analyses that take species evolutionary distance into account. Here we present a classification of the world's tropical forests based on their phylogenetic similarity. We identify five principal floristic regions and their floristic relationships: (i) Indo-Pacific, (ii) Subtropical, (iii) African, (iv) American, and (v) Dry forests. Our results do not support the traditional neo- versus paleotropical forest division but instead separate the combined American and African forests from their Indo-Pacific counterparts. We also find indications for the existence of a global dry forest region, with representatives in America, Africa, Madagascar, and India. Additionally, a northern-hemisphere Subtropical forest region was identified with representatives in Asia and America, providing support for a link between Asian and American northernhemisphere forests. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The use of natural resources can be a main source of disturbance to natural ecosystems if human populations depend heavily on biomass to attend to their basic needs. However, our understanding of how natural resource use affects natural ecosystems is insufficient. The Caatinga is the most populated dry forest worldwide, and inhabitants depend largely on the exploitation of the natural ecosystem for several purposes such as fuelwood and raising livestock. These constitute 'chronic anthropogenic disturbances' (CAD), the impacts of which, in the long run, may compete with habitat loss and impacts on ecosystem health. In this chapter I present a theoretical framework for the assessment of the impacts of three main sources of CAD on the Caatinga. I discuss how (1) firewood harvesting, (2) raising of free ranging goats, and (3) biological invasion are all linked to changes observed in the Caatinga biota. These sources of CAD are all linked to the socio-economic condition of human populations inhabiting the Caatinga and can be understood and, to some extent, quantified through socio-economic assessments. Finally, I propose a theoretical framework on how the original features of the Caatinga ecosystem may change as a function of the intensity of CAD, leading to two alternative states of both conserved and altered similarity to the original ecosystem. Understanding natural resource use by human populations is crucial to being able to assess the threats to biodiversity and ecosystem functions properly as well as to design conservation strategies to avoid both ecosystem degradation and depletion of human livelihoods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

	abstract = {Secondary forests are increasingly dominant in human-modified tropical landscapes, but the drivers of forest recovery remain poorly understood. Soil conditions influence plant community composition, and are expected to change over a gradient of succession. However, the role of soil conditions as an environmental filter driving community assembly during forest succession has rarely been explicitly assessed. We evaluated the role of stand basal area and soil conditions on community assembly and its consequences for community functional properties along a chronosequence of Atlantic forest regeneration following sugar cane cultivation. Specifically, we tested whether community functional properties are related to stand basal area, soil fertility and soil moisture. Our expectations were that edaphic environmental filters play an increasingly important role along secondary succession by increasing functional trait convergence towards more conservative attributes. We sampled soil and woody vegetation features across 15 second-growth (3–30 years) and 11 old-growth forest plots (300 m2 each). We recorded tree functional traits related to resource-use strategies (specific leaf area, SLA; leaf dry matter content, LDMC; leaf area, LA; leaf thickness, LT; and leaf succulence, LS) and calculated community functional properties using the community-weighted mean (CWM) of each trait and the functional dispersion (FDis) of each trait separately and all traits together. With exception of LA, all leaf traits were strongly associated with stand basal area; LDMC and SLA increased, while LT and LS decreased with forest development. Such changes in LDMC, LT and LS were also related to the decrease in soil nutrient availability and pH along succession, while soil moisture was weakly related to community functional properties. Considering all traits, as well as leaf thickness and succulence separately, FDis strongly decreased with increasing basal area and decreasing soil fertility along forest succession, presenting the lowest values in old-growth forests. Synthesis. Our findings suggest that tropical forest regeneration may be a deterministic process shaped by soil conditions. Soil fertility operates as a key filter causing functional convergence towards more conservative resource-use strategies, such as leaves with higher leaf dry matter content. © 2017 The Authors.

	abstract = {There is strong upswing in conservation and restoration efforts in Latin America (LA), particularly in the recent decades after several countries have committed to international agreements such as the Aichi targets of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Initiative 20×20, and the Bonn Challenge. To fulfill these agreements, the practice of ecological restoration has to be defined based on ecological knowledge, but also on the specific social, economic, and legal aspects of each country in the region. Here, we give some examples about the national understanding of ecological restoration in 10 countries of LA. We identify difficulties and opportunities to define restoration priorities and needs, and discuss some approaches to cope with economic constraints and agreements, including the potential role of restoration networks in this process. On the basis of the socioecological complexity of these countries and the expectations they have in relation to restoration, we proposed four approaches to guide restoration practice and policy in the region: (1) including biodiversity and ecosystem services approach into ecosystem restoration initiatives; (2) promoting restoration in their frequently human-modified landscapes; (3) accounting for cost–benefit trade-offs; and (4) assembling “horizontal” communication frameworks. These approaches should be based at national levels, but adapted to local-regional levels, in a bottom-up perspective. We consider that national and international restoration networks in the region can help to overcome difficulties, fostering a solid scientific community, helping to develop national approaches that better match the specific conditions of each country and enhancing communication among different groups of stakeholders. © 2016 Society for Ecological Restoration},

	abstract = {Old-growth tropical forests are being extensively deforested and fragmented worldwide. Yet forest recovery through succession has led to an expansion of secondary forests in human-modified tropical landscapes (HMTLs). Secondary forests thus emerge as a potential repository for tropical biodiversity, and also as a source of essential ecosystem functions and services in HMTLs. Such critical roles are controversial, however, as they depend on successional, landscape and socio-economic dynamics, which can vary widely within and across landscapes and regions. Understanding the main drivers of successional pathways of disturbed tropical forests is critically needed for improving management, conservation, and restoration strategies. Here, we combine emerging knowledge from tropical forest succession, forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to identify the main driving forces shaping successional pathways at different spatial scales. We also explore causal connections between land-use dynamics and the level of predictability of successional pathways, and examine potential implications of such connections to determine the importance of secondary forests for biodiversity conservation in HMTLs. We show that secondary succession (SS) in tropical landscapes is a multifactorial phenomenon affected by a myriad of forces operating at multiple spatio-temporal scales. SS is relatively fast and more predictable in recently modified landscapes and where well-preserved biodiversity-rich native forests are still present in the landscape. Yet the increasing variation in landscape spatial configuration and matrix heterogeneity in landscapes with intermediate levels of disturbance increases the uncertainty of successional pathways. In landscapes that have suffered extensive and intensive human disturbances, however, succession can be slow or arrested, with impoverished assemblages and reduced potential to deliver ecosystem functions and services. We conclude that: (i) succession must be examined using more comprehensive explanatory models, providing information about the forces affecting not only the presence but also the persistence of species and ecological groups, particularly of those taxa expected to be extirpated from HMTLs; (ii) SS research should integrate new aspects from forest fragmentation and landscape ecology research to address accurately the potential of secondary forests to serve as biodiversity repositories; and (iii) secondary forest stands, as a dynamic component of HMTLs, must be incorporated as key elements of conservation planning; i.e. secondary forest stands must be actively managed (e.g. using assisted forest restoration) according to conservation goals at broad spatial scales. © 2015 Cambridge Philosophical Society},

	abstract = {Competitor, stress-tolerator, ruderal (CSR) theory is a prominent plant functional strategy scheme previously applied to local floras. Globally, the wide geographic and phylogenetic coverage of available values of leaf area (LA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and specific leaf area (SLA) (representing, respectively, interspecific variation in plant size and conservative vs. acquisitive resource economics) promises the general application of CSR strategies across biomes, including the tropical forests hosting a large proportion of Earth's diversity. We used trait variation for 3068 tracheophytes (representing 198 families, six continents and 14 biomes) to create a globally calibrated CSR strategy calculator tool and investigate strategy–environment relationships across biomes world-wide. Due to disparity in trait availability globally, co-inertia analysis was used to check correspondence between a ‘wide geographic coverage, few traits’ data set and a ‘restricted coverage, many traits’ subset of 371 species for which 14 whole-plant, flowering, seed and leaf traits (including leaf nitrogen content) were available. CSR strategy/environment relationships within biomes were investigated using fourth-corner and RLQ analyses to determine strategy/climate specializations. Strong, significant concordance (RV = 0·597; P {\textless} 0·0001) was evident between the 14 trait multivariate space and when only LA, LDMC and SLA were used. Biomes such as tropical moist broadleaf forests exhibited strategy convergence (i.e. clustered around a CS/CSR median; C:S:R = 43:42:15\%), with CS-selection associated with warm, stable situations (lesser temperature seasonality), with greater annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Other biomes were characterized by strategy divergence: for example, deserts varied between xeromorphic perennials such as Larrea divaricata, classified as S-selected (C:S:R = 1:99:0\%) and broadly R-selected annual herbs (e.g. Claytonia perfoliata; R/CR-selected; C:S:R = 21:0:79\%). Strategy convergence was evident for several growth habits (e.g. trees) but not others (forbs). The CSR strategies of vascular plants can now be compared quantitatively within and between biomes at the global scale. Through known linkages between underlying leaf traits and growth rates, herbivory and decomposition rates, this method and the strategy–environment relationships it elucidates will help to predict which kinds of species may assemble in response to changes in biogeochemical cycles, climate and land use. © 2016 The Authors.

	abstract = {Seed-dispersal ecology in tropical montane forests (TMF) differs in some predictable ways from tropical lowland forests (TLF). Environmental, biogeographic and biotic factors together shape dispersal syndromes which in turn influence forest structure and community composition. Data on diaspore traits along five elevational gradients from forests in Thailand, the Philippines, Tanzania, Malawi and Nigeria showed that diaspore size decreases with increasing altitude, fleshy fruits remain the most common fruit type but the relative proportion of wind-dispersed diaspores increases with altitude. Probably corresponding to diaspore size decreasing with increasing elevation, we also provide evidence that avian body size and gape width decrease with increasing altitude. Among other notable changes in the frugivorous fauna across elevational gradients, we found quantitative evidence illustrating that the proportion of bird versus mammalian frugivores increases with altitude, while TMF primates decrease in diversity and density, and switch diets to include less fruit and more leaf proportionately. A paucity of studies on dispersal distance and seed shadows, the dispersal/predation balance and density-dependent mortality thwart much-needed conclusive comparisons of seed dispersal ecology between TMF and TLF, especially from understudied Asian forests. We examine the available evidence, reveal knowledge gaps and recommend research to enhance our understanding of seed dispersal ecology in tropical forests. This review demonstrates that seed dispersal is a more deterministic and important process in tropical montane forests than has been previously appreciated. © Cambridge University Press 2016.},

	abstract = {Habitat loss has been long recognized as a major driver of the current species extinction crisis, but to date few studies have estimated deforestation thresholds above which biodiversity negatively respond to the changes in landscape configuration. In this study, we used a very representative understory plant family (Rubiaceae) to evaluate the effects of forest cover reduction in the landscape on taxonomic and phylogenetic alpha and beta diversity, species originality, and composition. We selected nine Atlantic forest sites in southern Bahia, Brazil, immersed in landscapes ranging from 9\% to 71\% of remaining forest cover. We established a 50. ×. 100. m plot in each site and identified all the Rubiaceae individuals. Forest cover reduction at the landscape scale is strongly and negatively related to the number of individuals, species, and genera of Rubiaceae. Our model predicts that every 10\% decreasing in landscape forest cover results in the loss of about three species and 74 individuals of understory Rubiaceae. Canopy openness at the plot level increased linearly with the decrease of forest cover in the landscape. A trend of linear decrease of the phylogenetic diversity with the loss of forest cover was also observed, increasing the co-occurrence of close relatives in more deforested landscapes. Furthermore, we found a reduction in the presence of species with higher values of originality along the gradient of forest cover, as a consequence of species richness reduction. Regardless of the geographical distances, areas with similar values of forest cover were different in composition (β-diversity) and phylogenetic relationship (phylogenetic β-diversity), indicating that even highly deforested landscapes contribute to the regional diversity. We concluded that less forested areas are losing species richness and diversity, and as a consequence species originality, and presenting a general trend of phylogenetic impoverishment at the landscape scale. However, regional conservation initiatives should take all landscapes into account, because they all contribute to taxonomic and phylogenetic beta diversity, to ensure the long-term protection of the irreplaceable evolutionary history of Rubiaceae and the numerous organisms it supports. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Using a pantropical tree inventory database from closed canopy forests, consisting of 657,630 trees belonging to 11,371 species, we use a fitted value of Fisher's alpha and an approximate pantropical stem total to estimate the minimum number of tropical forest tree species to fall between ∼40,000 and ∼53,000, i.e., at the high end of previous estimates. Contrary to common assumption, the Indo-Pacific region was found to be as species-rich as the Neotropics, with both regions having a minimum of ∼19,000-25,000 tree species. Continental Africa is relatively depauperate with a minimum of ∼4,500-6,000 tree species. Very few species are shared among the African, American, and the Indo-Pacific regions. We provide a methodological framework for estimating species richness in trees that may help refine species richness estimates of tree-dependent taxa. © 2015, National Academy of Sciences.

We test the relationship between fuelwood consumption and per capita income for 270 households distributed over 7 rural settlements. In general 76\% of the households use fuelwood regularly and consume on average 686 kg/person/year of tree biomass, poorer people, however, consume 961 kg/person/year. Harvesting is concentrated to a few early successional species. Yet, annual rural population demand from 210 municipalities may reach 303,793 tons, equivalent to 1.2 to 2.1 thousand hectares of tropical forest. Fuelwood harvesting cannot be ignored as a major and chronic source of forest degradation in highly fragmented and densely populated landscapes and conciliating biodiversity conservation with poverty amelioration is an urgent task. © 2014 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Rainforests are undergoing severe deforestation and fragmentation worldwide. A huge amount of small forest patches are being created, but their value in conserving biodiversity and forest structure is still controversial. Here, we demonstrate that in a species-rich and moderately-managed Mexican tropical landscape small rainforest patches ({\textless}100 ha) can be highly valuable for the conservation of tree diversity and forest structure. These patches showed diverse communities of native plants, including endangered species, and a new record for the country. Although the number of logged trees increased in smaller patches, patch size was a poor indicator of basal area, stem density, number of species, genera and families, and community evenness. Cumulative species-area curves indicated that all patches had a similar contribution to the regional species diversity. This idea also was supported by the fact that patches strongly differed in floristic composition (high β-diversity), independently of patch size. Thus, in agreement with the land-sharing approach, our findings support that small forest patches in moderately-managed landscapes should be included in conservation initiatives to maintain landscape heterogeneity, species diversity, and ecosystem services.

	abstract = {Amazonian rainforests sustain some of the richest tree communities on Earth, but their ecological and evolutionary responses to human threats remain poorly known. We used one of the largest experimental datasets currently available on tree dynamics in fragmented tropical forests and a recent phylogeny of angiosperms to test whether tree communities have lost phylogenetic diversity since their isolation about two decades previously. Our findings revealed an overall trend toward phylogenetic impoverishment across the experimentally fragmented landscape, irrespective of whether tree communities were in 1-ha, 10-ha, or 100-ha forest fragments, near forest edges, or in continuous forest. The magnitude of the phylogenetic diversity loss was low ({\textless}2\% relative to before-fragmentation values) but widespread throughout the study landscape, occurring in 32 of 40 1-ha plots. Consistent with this loss in phylogenetic diversity, we observed a significant decrease of 50\% in phylogenetic dispersion since forest isolation, irrespective of plot location. Analyses based on tree genera that have significantly increased (28 genera) or declined (31 genera) in abundance and basal area in the landscape revealed that increasing genera are more phylogenetically related than decreasing ones. Also, the loss of phylogenetic diversity was greater in tree communities where increasing genera proliferated and decreasing genera reduced their importance values, suggesting that this taxonomic replacement is partially underlying the phylogenetic impoverishment at the landscape scale. This finding has clear implications for the current debate about the role human-modified landscapes play in sustaining biodiversity persistence and key ecosystem services, such as carbon storage. Although the generalization of our findings to other fragmented tropical forests is uncertain, it could negatively affect ecosystem productivity and stability and have broader impacts on coevolved organisms. © 2014 Santos et al.},

The Atlantic Forest Restoration Pact (AFRP) is a coalition of 260+ stakeholders, including governmental agencies, private sector, NGOs and research institutions, aimed at restoring 15 million ha of degraded and deforested lands by 2050. By articulating, and then integrating common interests, this initiative has allowed different sectors of society to implement an ambitious vision and create a forum for public and private concerns regarding forest restoration. The AFRP adopts a set of governance tools so multiple actors can implement key processes to achieve long-term and visionary restoration goals. Having overcome some initial challenges, AFRP now has to incorporate underrepresented stakeholders and enhance its efforts to make forest restoration more economically viable, including cases where restoration could be less expensive and profitable. The AFRP experience has resulted in many lessons learned, which can be shared to foster similar initiatives across tropical regions. © 2014 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Land-use change is the main driver of global biodiversity loss, but its relative impact on species turnover (β-diversity) across multiple spatial scales remains unclear. Plant communities in fragmented rain forests can undergo declines (floristic homogenization) or increases (floristic differentiation) in β-diversity. We tested these alternative hypotheses analysing a large vegetation data base from a hierarchically nested sampling design (450 plots in 45 forest patches in 3 landscapes with different deforestation levels) at Los Tuxtlas rain forest, Mexico. Differences in β-diversity across spatial scales (i.e. among plots, among patches, and among landscapes) were analysed using multiplicative diversity decompositions of Hill numbers. Plant β-diversity among plots within forest patches decreased in landscapes with higher deforestation levels, leading to floristic homogenization within patches. This homogenization process can be explained by the loss of rare and shade-tolerant plant species, and the recruitment and dominance of disturbance-adapted species, and can limit the accumulation of species (γ-diversity) in landscapes with higher deforestation. Nevertheless, the landscape with the highest deforestation level showed the highest floristic differentiation among patches. This landscape showed the greatest isolation distances between patches; a landscape spatial pattern that can limit the interchange of seeds (and species) between patches. Because the study patches are undergoing secondary succession following disturbances (e.g. logging, edge effects), different disturbance regimes and increased distance among patches could lead to higher β-diversity. Synthesis. These findings indicate that patterns of floristic homogenization and differentiation depend on the landscape configuration and on the spatial scale of analysis. At the landscape scale, our results suggest that, in accordance with non-equilibrium dynamics and the landscape-divergence hypothesis, patches located in landscapes with different forest cover and different connectivity can experience contrasting successional pathways due to increasing levels of compositional differentiation between patches. These novel findings add further uncertainties to the maintenance of biodiversity in severely deforested tropical landscapes and have key ecological implications for biodiversity conservation planning. © 2013 British Ecological Society.},

The approaches and lessons learned appear transferable, and could help achieve the global restoration targets. Fundamental prerequisites for success include: effective technology undergoing continuous improvement, ongoing teaching, outreach and capacity-building efforts, presence of local intelligentsia, maintaining a clear and transparent legal environment, and presence of effective economic instruments and incentives for landowners. These prerequisites can be achieved by expanding and strengthening the network of stakeholders both in public and private forums that must be aware of macro-economic and social/cultural shifts and trends which may provide opportunities and impose constraints to further restoration activities. Finally, environmental regulations imposing habitat protection and restoration are usually beyond individual land-owners' possibilities and level of interest.

This study tested the hypothesis that seedling assemblages in forest fragments differ from those across mature forest stands and examined to what extent the uncovered patterns supported the notion that edge-affected habitats tend to support impoverished tree assemblages dominated by pioneer species. We contrasted a series of small forest remnants (3-91 ha) to old-growth stands located in the largest (ca 3500 ha) and best preserved forest remnant in northeastern Brazil and found that tree seedling assemblages inhabiting forest fragments exhibited reduced species richness (up to 50\%) at different spatial scales in comparison to seedling assemblages in mature forest and adult assemblages in both fragments and mature forest stands. Moreover, ordination analyses clearly segregated fragment seedling assemblages in taxonomic/functional terms and segregation correlated to the richness of pioneer species. Seedlings of pioneer species and those bearing medium-sized seeds (0.6-1.5 cm) increased in fragments, whereas large-seeded species (1.5-3.0 cm) were reduced by more than a half. Such a multiple-scale replacement of the old-growth flora by pioneers was also confirmed by an indicator species analysis and the resulting pioneer indicator species. Our results suggest that small forest fragments support impoverished and distorted seedling assemblages. This floristic/functional drift implies that forest remnants or edge-affected habitats tend to be dominated by a small set of pioneer tree species rather than supporting a substantial portion of the old-growth flora as do mature forest stands. © 2012 The Author(s) Journal compilation © 2012 by The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation.},

	abstract = {In human-modified tropical landscapes, biodiversity is threatened by a myriad of forces, including habitat loss and fragmentation, land degradation, overexploitation of forest resources, and biological invasions. Ecological restoration offers a promising way to enhance biodiversity persistence and the delivery of ecosystem services by: 1) establishing structural elements in the landscape to enhance connectivity, 2) providing additional forest cover, 3) restoring degraded forest remnants through protection from human-mediated disturbances and reestablishment of successional trajectory, and 4) supporting sustainable socio-economic development in marginalized rural communities, where the lack of job opportunities drives deforestation, forest degradation, and overexploitation. Due to biodiversity requirements, however, this potential will only be realized if restoration is carried out on very large spatial scales. Although conservation biologists have historically doubted the potential of ecological restoration to reverse ecosystem degradation and mitigate species loss, we argue that conservation policies and programs should include restoration among the strategies adopted to mitigate extinction debts and support the creation of biodiversity friendly-landscapes. Otherwise, we will likely continue to describe a slow and irreversible loss of our biological heritage in isolated protected areas in human-modified tropical landscapes. © Pedro H. S.

We question the forest transition as a worldwide source of new secondary forest; the role played by regenerating (secondary) forest for biodiversity conservation, and the resilience of HMLs. We then offer a conceptual model describing potential successional trajectories among four major landscape types (natural, conservation, functional, and degraded) and highlight the potential implications of our model in terms of research agendas and conservation planning. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Despite its relevance to contemporary biodiversity conservation, the ecological mechanisms controlling nonrandom species replacements and biotic homogenization of native biotas remain poorly understood. Here, we advocate for the widespread occurrence of a pattern of winner-loser species turnover exhibited in tropical forest floras: the replacement of old-growth tree species by a small set of pioneer or successional tree species across edge-dominated habitats in hyper-fragmented landscapes. A growing body of evidence on biotic reassembly in human-degraded forest sites suggests that winner-loser replacements are often advanced by native rather than exotic plant species, leading to taxonomic homogenization at multiple spatial scales (i.e. from local to regional assemblages). This process does not rely on biological invasions and associated shifts in geographic ranges of nonindigenous species. Moreover, this form of biodiversity erosion is not limited to restricted-range and endemic species but can include any species of many ecological groups that are apparently intolerant to highly modified habitat conditions, such as desiccated/illuminated forest edges and fire-degraded forest fragments persisting in open-habitat matrices. This unidirectional pattern of species turnover is expected to set in motion devastating cascading effects onto higher trophic levels that will eventually disrupt the structure of the entire forest ecosystem. Our framework not only reaffirms the winner-loser replacement paradigm, but also contends that the proliferation of disturbance-adapted native organisms has a pivotal role in sealing the fate of tropical biodiversity in particular contexts. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we examine seedling assemblage attributes, seed germination and seedling survival across foraging zones of Atta cephalotes colonies inhabiting 15 second-growth patches (25-47 y old) of Atlantic forest. Seeds and seedlings were monitored within foraging zones and control sites over 1 y, including spots around ant nests. Overall, 1862 seedlings from 108 plant species were recorded. Seedling density decreased by 53\% in foraging-zone plots (3.31 ± 0.23 seedlings m-2) when compared with control plots (7.02 ± 0.44 seedlings m-2) and a similar decrease was observed for species richness. Ant-induced alterations in the seedling assemblage were further indicated by segregation between foraging-zone and control plots (NMDS), habitat effects on species similarity (ANOSIM), and indicator tree species associated with control plots. While seed germination and seedling survivorship were uncorrelated to either nest distance or age of second-growth stands (with the exception of Tapirira guianensis), defoliation by LCAs was a significant cause of seedling mortality. Our results suggest that LCAs interfere with successional trajectories of Atlantic forest as foraging zones filter seedling establishment, supporting less-dense, impoverished and convergent seedling assemblages.

	abstract = {Deforestation and forest fragmentation can drive species to local extinction, potentially changing the phylogenetic community structure and diversity of remaining assemblages. We tested this hypothesis analysing a large vegetation data set from a highly fragmented rain forest. We assessed 9000 trees (both saplings and adults) from 268 species in 45 rain forest patches (ranging from {\textless}1 to 700ha) in three landscapes with different deforestation levels (4\%, 11\%, and 24\% forest cover) in Los Tuxtlas, Mexico. We tested whether species density (i.e. number of species per unit area) and phylogenetic structure and diversity differed among landscapes, whether they were related to patch area, and whether the relationships differed among landscapes. Overall, the observed differences in sapling and adult species densities across forest patches and landscapes (e.g. lower species densities in smaller patches) resulted in few and very weak changes in the phylogenetic community structure and diversity. Our results indicate that local extirpation of tree species may occur randomly or uniformly (but not in a clustered manner) throughout the phylogenetic tree, supporting the hypothesis of low phylogenetic conservatism of traits associated with vulnerability to forest fragmentation in the Neotropics. Synthesis. This study indicates that in highly deforested and fragmented rain forests, the local extirpation of tree species does not occur across entire lineages. These novel and hopeful findings have direct implications for the ecology and conservation of fragmented rain forests. The maintenance of phylogenetic diversity in highly fragmented landscapes suggests that ecosystem function and stability may be maintained despite the loss of a number of tree species. We argue that in this unique Neotropical region, both large and small rain forest patches are critical for conserving regional tree evolutionary history. © 2012 The Authors.

In this study we used a chronosequence of advancing (19-62-yr old) Atlantic forest regeneration following slash-and-burn agriculture to infer successional shifts in seed rain in terms of seed density, species richness, taxonomic and functional composition, and local spatial distribution. After monitoring seed rain during 12 months in 60 1-m 2 seed traps, we recorded over 400,000 seeds belonging to 180 morphospecies. From early to late-successional stage, seed rain decreased in density, increased in per capita species richness, gradually changed in species composition, and became less aggregated spatially. Regardless the age of forest stand, vertebrate-dispersed seeds accounted for 67-75\% of all species recorded. Large-seeded species typical of old-growth forests, on the other hand, accounted for only 5-8\% of the species recorded in the seed rain, a proportion around five times smaller than that reported for the old-growth forests of the same study site (31\%). Our results suggest that the secondary forests considered, which are embedded in one of the largest (3500 ha) and best preserved remnant of the severely fragmented Atlantic forest of Northeast Brazil, may fail attaining older successional stages due to the reduced availability of large-seeded late-successional species. This regeneration constraint may be even stronger in smaller, more isolated forest remnants of the region, potentially reducing their ability to provide ecosystem services. © 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.},

International oil companies are aware of the potential of Brazilian ethanol and are investing in the production and expansion of sugarcane plantations in the country. The growing ethanol market imposes important conservation challenges on Brazil to meet increasing demand. The market points to an expansion of sugarcane crops, but this can be extremely harmful to biodiversity conservation in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. The impact of such expansion will be particularly severe in the Brazilian states of Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte, which together form the second largest sugar-ethanol production region in the country and one of the most globally threatened areas of tropical forest (only 12\% remaining, 1\% legally protected), with most forest fragments smaller than 100 ha and several endemic species on the verge of extinction. Here we advocate that instead of expanding plantations in those states, increasing crop productivity is the more logical and environmentally-friendly solution for that region. This report emphasizes the need to increase the number of sugar and ethanol companies following best management practices and to adapt such practices to restore biodiversity and environmental services within threatened ecosystems.

	abstract = {Aim To examine whether the tree flora of the Atlantic forest of northeastern Brazil has experienced detectable taxonomic homogenization via the proliferation of native pioneer species in response to habitat loss and fragmentation. Location Biotic homogenization (BH) was examined across the Atlantic forest of northeast Brazil, i.e. a 56,000km2 piece of tropical forest and a distinct centre of species endemism in South America. Methods We assessed a dataset consisting of 5122 tree records and compared the similarity of tree floras from 12 semi-natural sub-regions of the Atlantic forest between two time periods: pre-1980 (plant records between 1902 and 1980), and post-1980 (between 1981 and 2006). To understand the mechanisms leading to BH (1) tree floras were ordered (via non-metric multidimensional scaling - NMDS) by date (pre/post 1980) based on species occurrence and frequency, (2) NMDS axes were regressed against the proportion of those species that increased their occurrence post-1980 (i.e. the winner species), and (3) patterns of geographic distribution and frequency of particular life-history traits were examined across winner species and a control group. Results Tree floras across the Atlantic forest became c.20-40\% more similar to each other post-1980, but patterns of species similarity were also influenced by between-plot geographical distance. NMDS ordination clearly segregated pre- and post-1980 floras with a clear signal of floristic convergence. Furthermore, winner tree species were largely composed of short-lived and small-seeded pioneer species that exhibit wide geographic distributions. Main conclusions Our results suggest that tropical forest biotas are susceptible to taxonomic homogenization (i.e. increasing levels of similarity) in the context of severe human-disturbance via the proliferation of particular groups of native species comprised mainly by ecologically-plastic, generalist species. We are thus extending the concept of homogenization to address and highlight a pervasive biological shift in the structure of tropical forest communities currently taking place across hyper-fragmented landscapes. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

In five fragments (2.3-640 ha) and one continuous forest site we sampled tree and seedling species in 40 (20×20 m) and 120 (3×3 m) plots respectively, and recorded the incidence (presence/absence) of the disperser fauna (three common large-birds and {\textgreater}500-g mammals). Tree and seedling species were categorized according to dispersal mode, seed size and whether they originated from local (i.e. from dropped) or immigrant (i.e. from actively dispersed) seeds. Fragment size negatively correlated with number of species of medium to large vertebrate seed-dispersers and number of seedlings of large-seeded species, but had no influence on functional traits of the adult-tree community. Between 41\% and 61\% of all seedlings were considered as immigrants and the proportion of immigrant seedlings of large-seeded tree species was negatively correlated with forest size.

In this study we assessed a set of 10 aged ({\textgreater} 80 years) fragments (3.0 - 3,500 ha in size) of the Atlantic forest to examine to what extent fragment microclimatic attributes are correlated with distance to the nearest edge as frequently proposed in the literature. We used 129 sampling points and took a total of 516 measures of air temperature and humidity, vapor pressure deficit and light incidence to characterize the microclimate of forest fragments in terms of their relative deviation from the surrounding matrix. Fragments as a whole presented strong internal variation and strongly differed from the microclimate exhibited by the open matrix of sugar-cane fields. Distance to nearest edge, percentage of forest cover around the measurement point, percentage of edge-affected area, and geographical orientation of the nearest edge all proved to have minor effects on the microclimate of forest fragments. Conversely, we identified percentage of forest cover and fragment area as the most significant explanatory variables driving their microclimatic configuration: as forest cover increases at landscape scale, forest microclimate deviates less from the open matrix (a forest-mediated matrix buffering). Our results suggest that microclimatic conditions are spatially complex, as they do not correlate with the distance to the nearest forest edges; rather, they are driven by a forest-mediated buffering of the surrounding matrix that minimizes heat and humidity exchanges between forest and non-forest habitats, thus shaping the microclimatic signature of isolated forest fragments. © Severino R.

These relatively small-bodied bats are well-known dispersal agents for many small-seeded plant species, but are assumed to play a negligible role in the dispersal of large-seeded plants. We investigated the importance of the small tent-roosting bat Artibeus watsoni for dispersal of large seeds in the Sarapiquí Basin, Costa Rica. We registered at least 43 seed species {\textgreater} 8 mm beneath bat roosts, but a species accumulation curve suggests that this number would increase with further sampling. Samples collected beneath bat feeding roosts had, on average, 10 times more seeds and species than samples collected 5 m away from bat feeding roosts. This difference was generally smaller in small, disturbed forest patches. Species-specific abundance of seeds found beneath bat roosts was positively correlated with abundance of seedlings, suggesting that bat dispersal may influence seedling recruitment.

The study was carried out in the Coimbra forest (3500 ha), the largest fragment currently found in the Atlantic forest of northeast Brazil. We assessed seed rain during a 1-year period by using a 1500-m long transect (with 100 sampling units) for each habitat. Seeds were categorized according to size, dispersal mode, and vertebrate manipulation. A total of 76,207 seeds belonging to 146 species were collected during the whole study and in average edge received more seeds and species per unit of area during particular periods of time. However, the analysis of all seeds and species recorded in both habitats during the 1-year period revealed that forest interior received a significant higher percentage of medium, large and very large seeds (21.8\%) and species (82.6\%) in comparison to edge (13.5\% of seeds and 57.5\% of species). The contribution of large and very large seed species dispersed by vertebrates was also lower in the edge forest as it represented 13.04\% of all vertebrate-dispersed species recorded in this habitat vs. 31.5 \% in the forest interior. Finally, seeds handled by vertebrates accounted for 5.9\% of all seeds in forest edge, and reached 11\% in the forest interior. The biased seed rain documented in the Coimbra forest raises the possibility that the creation of forest edges may alter some attributes of seed rain, particularly its content of large-seeded plants and of those dispersed by vertebrates. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Here we describe the seed shadow, seedling recruitment, ontogenetic structure and spatial distribution of Buchenavia capitata (an emergent canopy tree) in a 380-ha fragment of the Atlantic forest in northeast Brazil. In particular, we examine seed distribution around 10 parental trees and both seedling recruitment and mortality, during an 18 month period beneath and around parental trees. Moreover, we describe: (1) B. capitata occurrence within treefall gaps; (2) population structure in terms of ontogenetic stages for the whole site; and (3) spatial distribution of adults within an area of 51 hectares. 99\% of seeds were found beneath parent crowns (n = 4,236) and seed density reached 14.6 ± 29.9 seeds/m2 (0-140 seeds/m 2). 49\% of all seeds germinated but seedling mortality reached 100\% after an 18 month period. In addition, saplings of B. capitata were not found in forest understory and within 30 treefall gaps (94-2,350 m2). The adults showed an average DBH of 69.3 ± 22.1 cm, were 19.2 ± 2.9 m tall and presented a clumped spatial distribution. B. capitata matched some of the features presented by shade intolerant trees or large-gap specialists, and we hypothesize that low rates or even lack of long distance seed dispersal events may be reducing the probability of B. capitata seeds reaching suitable habitats for successful seedling recruitment and growth. Because of that (1) seedlings face high levels of early mortality; (2) there is no sapling recruitment at the study site; and (3) local population faces senility and it is threatened by local extinction.},

	abstract = {This study investigates the relationships among seed dispersal, patterns of seedling recruitment and the spatial distribution of a pioneer tree (Hortia arborea, Rutaceae) in the Brazilian Atlantic forest. The study was carried out at Dois Irmãos Reserve, a 387.4 ha reserve in northeastern Brazil. Fruit shadow concentrated beneath parental trees (74.6\% {\textless} 6 m distant) and fruit removal averaged 5.6\% (0-25.5\%). Agoutis (Dasyprocta prymnolopha, Rodentia) ate fruits in the forest and in captivity and were the only vertebrates recorded feeding on Hortia fruits. Agoutis, however, destroyed 86.7\% of the seeds they ingested. In addition, only one seed from an expected number of 1980 germinated in a treefall gap after it passed through the digestive tract of agoutis. Both seed germination and seedling recruitment were restricted to gaps, and occurred among seeds manually released from the pulp or among those from fruits that naturally rotted in gaps. Moreover, exposed seedlings were taller than those covered by plants in a gap. H. arborea appears to self-maintain populations in the same patches of forest, which are delimited by a pool of old and newly created gaps. More specifically, there is successful recruitment in patches occupied by parents, resulting in dense clumps of H. arborea.},
